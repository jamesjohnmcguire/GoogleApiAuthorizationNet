#### Unit Tests
Actually, more accurate would be to call them automated tests.  In any case, in order to have the tests succeed, you need to set an environment variable to a directory containing test files.  The environment variable is: GOOGLEAPIAUTHORIZER_TEST_DIRECTORY

This test directory should contain three files of the following:
credentials.json
ServiceAccount.json
tokens.json

These are the authorization files provided by your Google project.
